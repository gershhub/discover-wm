# Discover

## Web interface for exploring deep audio embeddings

This project is a web audio interface for the Wandering Mind, built using React. At start, the application loads in a json-formated data file of 2d points corresponding to short audio clips, as well as a list of associated files. The short clips are accessed in the associated files by seeking to the index point  indicated in the json.

The project was commissioned by slow immediate. Development was led by Nan Zhao of Nayo, with feedback and adjustments from Gershon Dublon of slow immediate. The project was forked in March 2021 for research purposes with the team at DVIC.

## Running the application 

#### Before you start

A database of audio files must be supplied to the application in order to run it. The easiest way to do this without moving large numbers of files around is using a symbolic link called "sample" in the "/public" directory to a mounted drive or directory.

Various node versions are likely to work, but we can guarantee node 12. 
 
Run `yarn install`.

#### To run the application

Run `yarn start`. A browser window should open, pointing to `localhost:3000`.

## More info / autogenerated things

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
